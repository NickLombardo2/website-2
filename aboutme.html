      <h2>About Me:</h2>
      <p class="intro">Successfully completed 100 days of code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022 and The Complete Web Developer in 2022: Zero to Mastery on Udemy where I spent over 100 hours coding. This class gave me the fundamentals, and advanced skills needed for software engineers.  I share my projects on my GitHub which is NickLombardo2. I am looking to move into my passion which is a more technical role such as software engineering. I am currently a detail-oriented Financial Analyst with background leveraging hands-on experience in quantitative analysis, accounting, and forecasting. I also have demonstrated expertise in inventory cost accounting and management of general finance and accounting functions. Superior analytical skills, practiced at drilling down to transaction/workflow details in support of process and profit improvement. Collaborate effectively with business managers to resolve variances, refine forecasts, and identify opportunities for improvement.</p>
